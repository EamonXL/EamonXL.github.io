# About Me

Eamon Challinor

Background: Bachelors of the Arts in Computer Science

Minors: Global Engagement and Environmental Studies.

Areas of Interest: Game Development, Back-end Development and Bioinformatics.

Hello my name is Eamon and I an interdisciplinary computer science student at the University of Washington Tacoma. The aspect of computer science that has drawn me towards the field is the sheer level of versatility technology offers when it comes to creating impactful solutions. Even when I first began learning how to code in high school, there was a sense of uniqueness and creativity for what could be created with computer science with my first two projects being an animated app that provides information about different animals and a randomly generated quiz that accessed a table of data about different countries. As a current senior, this philosophy of mine has not changed with my current pursuits revolving around how technology can be used to bring positive impacts to art, biology and the world. Whether it be pursuing an interest in video games or bioinformatics, computer science has served as my canvas and instrument for pursuing interests I have for my academic, professional and personal growth.

**Extracurricular Activities**

Outdoors Club - Treasurer: Working as an officer of the UWT Outdoors Club to create outdoor related events and help to create an inclusive environment for everyone with any level of skill interested in exploring the outdoors. Additional duties involve creating fundraisers and making funding request for events and promotional materials.

WICYS (Women in Cybesecurity) - Member: Learning about the world of cybersecurity and participating in resume workshops, industry panels, hacking competitions and additional resources in the field of cybersecurity.

Game Development Club - Member: Developing skills to understand how to develop games in various game engines such as Godot and Unity.

Hobbies: During my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing/creating video games, tidepooling and rock wall climbing!


# Projects 
1.) File System Watcher

Description: Collaborating in a small team of three members to create a file system watcher where a user can assign watchers to specified files that will log updates and will store relevant metadata changes (file name, file path, type of change, etc.) in an SQL database. Gmail API is used to handle credentials for sending logs as emails through the applicatiion with API permissions granted through Google Cloud CLI. Additionally, users are able to export file update logs in the form of a CSV file to a specified file path. Development organized using YouTrack to organize tasks and workflows, Agile Software Development lifecycle for development timeline and creation of relevant documents such as an SRS document, UML class diagrams and User Stories.

Key Takeaways: 
- Understanding how APIs can be integrated and used through learning how to use Maven.
- Creating a functional application through full stack development with both the back end logic and front end GUI.
- Utilizing token credentials to create permissions for gmail functionality.

Challenges: 
- Adapting to and learning the Agile Software Development lifecycle.
- Leadership and team responsibilities designating tasks and communicating issues that arise.
- Understanding the MVC and its contributions to reducing tight coupling. 

Technologies Used: Gmail API, SQL, SQLite, Maven, Google Cloud CLI, Java, Draw.io UML, YouTrack, MVC design pattern, GitHub, Git.

2.) Roguelite Minesweeper

![Screenshot 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EamonXL/EamonXL.github.io/main/Screenshot%202025-12-02%20004318.png)


Description: Personal project adapting the classic version of minesweeper wiith a level based twist where levels get progressively more difficult with choosing different curses (numbers disappear after a short amount of time, increase the number of bombs, adding a time limit, etc.). Game created using sprite art and map is generated through a custom made tile generation system that utilizes scaled up sprites to represent squares on the minesweeper grid.

Technologies Used: Java, Java Swing, Aseprite, Paint.NET, MVC design pattern.

Key Takeaways:
- Going through the process of working on a game and all the aspects necessary (sprite work/art, music, game logic, visual feedback & indicators, etc.).
- Finding ways to solve programming related challenges through troubleshooting and trial/error researching on Google.
- Continue to practice full stack development through creating the GUI and the back end logic for the game.

Challenges:
- Learning how to create a functional game without the use of a game engine.
- Developing the skills necessary to find solutions independently.

3.) Pokedex

![Screenshot 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EamonXL/EamonXL.github.io/main/Screenshot%202025-12-02%20004144.png)

Description: Personal project to practice the process of creating an interactable user interface through creating a simple version of a Pokedex. The Pokedex contains the original 151 Pokedex and allows for the user to scroll through and choose each of the different Pokemon to learn about their name, types, ID and sprite.

Key Takeaways:
- Learning the fundamentals of Java Swing (JFrames, JPanels, JButtons, event handlers).
- Beginning the process of creating personal projects.

Challenges:
-Understanding how to customize different elements of the GUI (draw to create shape, displaying images and using the different layouts to create visuals.

Technologies Used: Java, Java Swing.

# Skills
Programming Languages: Java, Python and Javascript.

IDE: IntelliJ and Eclipse.

Technologies: GitHub, Git, Maven, SQL, SQLite, Google CLI, and Godot.

Other Software: Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Aseprite, Paint.NET, and Figma.

Work Tools: YouTrack, UML Class Diagrams, and SRS Documents.

# Experience
1.) ASU SolarSPELL Intern STEM Content Curator

Description: Working in an indisciplinary team of students across different STEM majors to curate open access educational content for the SolarSPELL East Africa offline digital library. Implementing and utilizing an educational GPT to automate metadata tagging workflows as well as archiving all curated resources by team members to avoid curating the same resource. Presenting team progress during the all team round table and final presentation as well recieve user feedback (survey data, user data, stakeholder needs) for future curation.

Role: Original team member that helped with the onboarding process for new members of the team and coordinating team based work such as team presentations.

2.) International AI Copyright Independent Research Capstone

Description: Independent research overseen by a faculty mentor responsible for advising and grading final version of the capstone thesis. The paper revolves around international legal frameworks and evaluating how equip they are for handling the sociotechnological changes introduced by large language models with the main being that the issue isn't rooted in a need for transformative law but rather definitive interpretation of existing legal frameworks. Various international case studies are explored for the US, EU and Japan where the rights based copyright framework is present. 

Role: Independent student researcher.
